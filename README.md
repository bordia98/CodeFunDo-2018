#  D-Plan CodeFunDo-2018


## Problem Statement:
D-Plan here stands for the Plan required to be executed after any disaster. As we had seen many time when a natural disaster strikes a place, even after having the resources to recover from the damage caused by the disaster the people will not get benefited from them. This is because of the poor management of the resources and manpower.

Sometimes even when the government is providing help to the people the coverage of it is restricted and the people suffering from the problem with the lack of information that the help is near them suffered badly still. Sometimes people from the locality also come-up to help the needed in such conditions but the person in need will never come to know about this.

## Idea:
So in order to encounter every such scenario, we will try to come up with a platform which will carry all the details in one place when there is a need.
This will help different roles in places like the government/army help, locality help, and the people who are in need of help. The suffering people will see all the nearby options needed and if they are in danger they can share their location with the people helping if anyone can reach out to them to help. One place where everyone can have access.

The above idea can be of any place and any disaster which will occur. One just have to enter the disaster and location where it is happening the access of this will be given to admin only and start the thread of help with the above mentioned roles and anyone can commute so a better management can be done.


After we will develop and test the above platform we will try to implement Machine learning in this so that the platform will improve itself.
